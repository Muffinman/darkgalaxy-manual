This manual includes several data exports in a Tab Separated Format (TSV) which represent the most recent data and values taken directly from the live game.

This data is designed to be used as an import into other applications, spreadsheets, or tools, and hopefully help remove a lot of the manual work involved in things like calculators.

The following exports are available:

- [List of Resources](/content/exports/list-of-resources.raw)
- [List of Colonists](/content/exports/list-of-colonists.raw)
- [List of Ships](/content/exports/list-of-ships.raw)
- [List of Structures](/content/exports/list-of-structures.raw)
