`Universe` -> `Galaxy` -> `Sector` -> `System`

## Universe view

The universe is split up into 49 Galaxies in a ring pattern as below. The central galaxy has the richest resources, but will also be the most highly contested region of space. Resource density decreases the further the galaxy is from the centre.

Travel times between galaxies may vary - please see the [travel times](/content/reference/travel-times.md) reference page for more details on exact travel times between locations.

## Galaxy view

Once you click in to view a galaxy, you will be presented with the galaxy view, showing all the sectors within that galaxy. Within a galaxy all sectors are equal, there is no difference in resource density, and travel times between sectors are all equal (assuming no [Fleet Beacon or Jump Gates](/content/reference/list-of-structures.md)).

- Galaxy 1 has 25 sectors
- Galaxies 2 - 13 have 6 sectors
- Galaxies 14 - 25 have 2 sectors

## Sector view

As per the galaxy, system-system travel times within a sector are all equal. There are no differences in travel times.

- Galaxy 1 has 4 systems per sector
- Galaxies 2 - 13 have 4 systems per sector
- Galaxies 14 - 25 have 4 systems per sector

## System view

The system view shows all planets within that system. Systems in outer galaxy ring have 9 planets. Systems in Galaxy 1 have 12 planets.

- Galaxy 1 has 12 planets per system
- Galaxies 2 - 13 have 9 planets per system
- Galaxies 14 - 25 have 9 planets per system
